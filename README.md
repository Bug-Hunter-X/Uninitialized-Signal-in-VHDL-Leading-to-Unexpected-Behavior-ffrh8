This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked bug in VHDL: uninitialized signals.  The `bug.vhdl` file contains code with an uninitialized signal `internal_data`.  This can cause unexpected results in simulation and synthesis because the initial value is undefined. The `bugSolution.vhdl` provides a corrected version, initializing the signal to a known value. This example highlights the importance of proper signal initialization in VHDL for robust and predictable designs.
